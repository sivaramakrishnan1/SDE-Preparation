<h1 align="center">Software Development Engineer <br> 
(Preparation) </h1>

Hi! This is my repository containing all my codes during the preparation of getting software developer job. I done few leetcode problems and some interview questions asked in [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/)

## Blueprint of this repository
1. [Leet Code](/Leet%20Code/)
    1. Folder name : LeetCode problem number
        1. A `txt` file containing the description of the problem.
        2. A solved `java` program for the problem specified. 
        3. A `class` file that compiled, so kindly ignore.

2. [Zoho](/Zoho/)
    1. Level - 2
        * This folder contains various problems asked in Zoho along with a [`pdf`](/zoho2.pdf) 
        that containing all the questions that is solved and yet-to-be solved.
        * The program file name format is  **s-(followed by a number)-p-(followed by a number)**
        <br> _For example :_ The solution program for `Set-1:Problem-1` is saved as 
        [s1p1.java](/Zoho/Level%202/s1p1.java)
    2. Level - 3
        * This folder will have programs of advanced coding round. 

3. [Patterns](/PatternProblems/)
    1. Numerical Patterns
        * A [`.md file`](/PatternProblems/Numerical_Patterns/ReadMe.md) explaining all the patterns and the program file's name to generate that pattern is mentioned.
    2. Star Patterns
        * A [`.md file`](/PatternProblems/Star_Pattern/ReadMe.md) explaining all the patterns and the program file's name to generate that pattern is mentioned.
